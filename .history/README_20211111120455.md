The site aims to make it easier for anyone to start working in creative industries that are difficult to enter. 

Targeted at creative people with no experience or training  and small brands/companies with a small budget, looking to connect with each other to work on projects.

Our intended users are not only people wanting to get more professional experience, but also hobby artists and performers.

Our site provides a platform for both sides, talent (actors, models) and project organisers (companies, film directors, fashion brands, or whatever, etc) to collaborate.

How does it work ?
Example:
-Director posts a listing
-Model comments on post - “im interested”
-Model sends Private Message to Directors “hi my name is blah blah i like your project etc”
-Model clicks “share portfolio” button --- portfolio is shared to Director
 
Also can work other way around :::::::::::. Model or Actor creates a post / listing
 
Questions:
-can ppl register as multiple things - model, also director, also designer, also actor etc etc etc

OK SO:
Idea is : first, you see a registration page,
After registration, you see the profiles directly
Only other page is then chat


Notes:
API for location etc --- google distances ?
