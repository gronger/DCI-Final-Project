      <h2>My idea is that this website gives beginners/people without money or experience in film or fashion the opportunity to organise a project:on the "user" side, models with no agencies, actors with no training, for example, can look here for projects they want to take part in. Also film directors and fashion designers who dont have budget can look for models and actors on the "employer" side.My idea was to take away the agency and give both sides more independence. Models dont have to wait to be contacted and told what to do. They can actively search out projects they are interested in and message the production directly.
